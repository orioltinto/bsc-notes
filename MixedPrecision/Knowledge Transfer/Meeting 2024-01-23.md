## EDITO: 
 Digital Twin of the Ocean lead by Mercator. The target is to make a mixed-precision version of Orca36. Other GPU tasks as well. 
 Aprox deadline: Starts at June
 
## ESiWACE3
- Deadline for deliverable 1: End of December 2024. Improve AutoRPE. Idea of creating a kind of linter.
- WP4 Services:
	- "Ongoing" service going on with KNMI en EC-Earth with M7 aerosol. In principle it could be ongoing but there are few tasks that they want to do in advance. 
	- New call will open and mixed will be one of the possible options. 
- WP2 end of 2024:
	- CMCC must generate a version with psyclone and we need to port it to MN5. 
## Destination Earth
- Deadline now Mixed precision for ORCA12.
- Probably they want to optimise this version for the next phase of DE that will start after April.

## EERIE
- The idea was to use the same DE version and report the same stuff. Not clear if that is possible due to DE proprietary reasons.
