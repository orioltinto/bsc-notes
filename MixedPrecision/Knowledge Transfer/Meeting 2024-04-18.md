# Notes de l'Oscar

Work related to DE_340
Autosubmit experiments
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a63q (for binary tree and eORCA1 validation)
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a6fs (for eORCA12 validation)
Binary tree jobs
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32402/a5x6/analysis (complete set is in Stella’s scratch)
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a63q/analysis (Oscar’s scratch, does not contain all jobs), also contains scripts “generate_status_analysis.sh” and “accuracy_test_online.sh” that generate a status report of each experiment if it has not been done before (but these may already be in the repository)
Analysis results (banned variables and root configs)
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a63q/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/analysis_results
Run parameters and paths with relevant data
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a63q/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/parameters.cfg
Ensembles for validation (only contain scalar results since we had to delete data due to space limitations)
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a63q/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/ENSEMBLE_50_55
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a63q/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/ENSEMBLE_55_60
Scripts to compute RMSE, grid mean, and relative error (inside /gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a63q/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/EvaluationScripts/ensemble)
compute_grid_mean_serial
compute_members_RMSE
compute_rel_max_error
Scripts with multiprocessing library implemented (in same directory, they might have errors that produce different results than the serial versions)
compute_members_RMSE_multip_3
compute_RMSRE_multip
compute_grid_mean_multip
Plots used for validation
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a63q/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/ENSEMBLE_RMSE/eORCA1 (.pkl files used to generate the plots)
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a63q/images/namelist_orca12 (contains RMSE, and grid mean for different years)
Runs for eORCA12 validation
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a6fs/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/ORCA12_ensemble (restart files had to be deleted due to space limitations but the directory contains the output from all the 5 years of simulation)
Inidata and configuration for eORCA12 runs
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a6fs/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/inidata_orca12 (also contains initial restart files)
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a6fs/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/configuration_orca12
Script used to run eORCA12 chunks (it’s called from autosubmit, it is a bit rudimentary but worked well using the a6fs autosubmit experiment)
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a6fs/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/recipes/ORCA12_ensemble.sh
Previous work with NEMO4.2
Experiments of different analysis: /gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/ 
a5ar (ORCA2 OCE)
a5w5 (ORCA1 OCE)
a5x8 (ORCA2 OCE+ICE)
a61z (Combination of root configs from a5w5 and a5x8)
Root configurations.
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a5ar/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/root_configuration (ORCA2 OCE, this was validated and was used to integrate mixed precision into the NEMO repo)
/gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a61z/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/root_configuration.txt (from a61z, the version is not fully validated but this can be used to implement changes)
Banned variables of experiments
a5w5: /gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a61z/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/banned_variables_other_analysis/banned_variables_ORCA1.txt
a5x8: /gpfs/scratch/bsc32/bsc32331/a61z/precisionoptimizationworkflow4nemo/banned_variables_other_analysis/banned_variables_ORCA2_ICE.txt

Ideas for AutoRPE and analysis
Play with the accuracy test parameter, we could reduce the number of required variables by increasing the parameter without affecting the validation tests
Select casts carefully
Overhead should be measured somewhat accurately
For each variable, take into account: number of required casts, dimension of the variable, placement inside loops. The vault created by the Castfix script should contain all necessary information.
Then implement algorithm that decides when to cast variables and when to leave original precision based on the total overhead that adding casts would create
There are a lot of casts in control print subroutine. It could be switched to single precision or deactivated when we want to get the most out of mixed.
Allow for reanalysis (needs to allow to redo accuracy test)
