# CATS meeting

- Mario explains that in the next phase the reporting will change.
- Will have development and operational cycles.
- The idea is to split the tasks and don't have common tasks with other teams to avoid repeating the fact that BSC ends up making all work.
- For the news release that will happen at the end of the month, e need to collect some metrics to support our story.
- We had a discussion about the Mixed Precision:They say that there's variability in the mixed-precision code that doesn't seem to happen in the double one. We might need to continue the discussion in another moment. 
- System instability was mentioned again. We commented that adding a kind of tiny benchmark to be sure that the system works properly would be adequate. Alexey already did something and maybe we can extend it.
