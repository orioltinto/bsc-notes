# Validation

- Andrew C. on validation of the GEOMETRIC (?) configuration: waiting on a new hire, not sure this will happen this year. 
- There's a discussion on what kind of validation information we need to collect for CMEMS (Copernicus Marine Services). They talk about including performance information as well. One idea is to show that N4 and N5 give similar results (?).
- How to validate? ERA5? It seems that we don't have a proper forcing from ERA5 yet.
- eORCA36 comparing NEMO4 vs NEMO4.2 with RK3:
	- 120s MLF timestep to 300s RK3 timestep ends up with a 30% performance improvement, everyone expects it to be faster in N5 since it was a RK3 version that was in development.
- Black Sea MFC:
	- 1/40º 121 vertical levels.
	- N5 is reproducibe. 
	- 4.2 vs 5 (rk3 double step):
		- similar bias and errors
			- exception, small degradation in SLA (?)
		- same skill for sst
		- similar transport 
	- Some differences with different bulks that end up with different nemo versions(?).

- About XIOS3:
	- Much better memory footprint.
	- on old xios2 with O36 in MetOffice they had to allocate more nodes for IO than computing.

# NEMO 5 Timeline discussion
- Hard to have a serious "validation" for June. (CMEMS mentioned again as main stakeholder). Talking about postponing release to September.
- Should we use XIOS3 as default? Still beta version and moving trunk.
- Gurvan mentions that we might want to validate with MLF and also RK3 to isolate potential error sources.

# Testing in NEMO
- SETTE tests whole configurations. Hard to tell what is failing.
- Unit tests would complement sette: Example with the library pFUnit.
- It is already possible for the users to extend SETTE with additional configurations.
- Suggestion to extend it to cover more things. (tools, memory usage, diagnostics, ... , )
- What do we do when the results change? 
# Scientific validation (Guillaume)
- Sette verifies few things but does not evaluate physical consistency of the results.
- Few examples of simulations missing for reasons that were undetected by sette. 
# Gitlab
- Issues:
	- Templates up to date?
	- Proper naming?
	- Squash or not to squash?
	  Keeping all commits leads to an unreadable tree, squashing the commits leads to some information missing.
  - The consensus is that:
	  - Rebase - Squash - Merge
# Merge requests
- Clement is going through all the open merge requests to discuss whether they are still relevant or not. Closing most of them for being irrelevant.
# Issues
- same thing with issues. They realised nobody was reading the non-assigned issues...

# Talk:
- **Diego Bruciaferri**: “Exploring efficient modeling methods for improving flow-topography interactions in global ocean models “

# Motivate coding in NEMO with RK3
- To run with RK3: activate key, set nn_bt_flt = 3 and adapt rn_Dt and nn_fsbc.
- Sibylle and Gurvan made an overview of how the rk3 scheme works.
