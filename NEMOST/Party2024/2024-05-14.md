# Outstanding challenges for NEMO 5

- Discussing issues with trends. Gurvan and Seb think that it is not a priority and it shouldn't go in v5. Looks like might work but hasn't been tested. No many users so low level.
- Discussing what has been tested with RK3. It looks like it is not clear what works and what does not. Many components that have not been tested/validated. Again, it seems that a robust way of validating changes would massively benefit development.
# Presentation from  Antoine Nasser
- Incorporating the Brinkman Penalisation method for enhanced representation of topography in OGCMs.
